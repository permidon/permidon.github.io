        <p>Think about it. If you're the person who helps and mentors others in these technologies, you must know these technologies well enough. Employers LOVE that! It makes you stand out from the crowd. It also helps you improve your own knowledge as you help solve a wide variety of issues. Besides, helping others improve is always a good thing.</p>

        <p>Another reminder... For students who have not yet completed the course and are switching to the new session, you'll notice that, by popular request, I have split up the last module into 2 separate smaller modules to give you more time to finish the course without causing you to have to switch sessions, etc. I hope this will make it a less stressful learning experience for you! And, of course, you CAN finish earlier if you want to go faster.</p>
