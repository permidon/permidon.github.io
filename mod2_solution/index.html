        <p>Since the advent of television, TV sets always occupied a prominent place on the floor on a shelf or in an entertainment center in the middle of the room. Everything changed with the development and popularity of flat screens, however. Now an HDTV monitor can be placed just about anywhere in a living space, thanks primarily to the light and thin properties of today’s televisions – but with a lot of the credit also going to the many versatile TV brackets you can use to hang lightweight screens.</p>

        <p>Anyone who’s been using audio equipment for any length of time probably has "the box". It might not be an actual box; it could be a shelf, a corner of a closet or a desk drawer. But whatever form it takes, it’s in most homes: the area where old cables, adapters and connectors get tossed, get tangled up and are left to die. You might tackle "the box" every so often when you’re in desperate need of a particular adapter or connector, but you know in advance that you’ll never find what you need in "the box".</p>

        <p>Every home has a variety of electronic devices that can be connected together for work or entertainment. For instance, you can connect the HDTV screen with a video game player, a DVD player, camera, or some other electronic gadget to ensure that you can enjoy high quality video. However, connecting these devices together often requires a lot of unsightly wires behind your TV leading to the device. This also makes cleaning more difficult and can lead to visual clutter.</p>
